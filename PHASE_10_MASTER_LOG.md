## STRATEGIC OUTCOME
- **Hidden Logic:** Title tags now front-load high-value triggers (e.g., "Hard-Stop", "Legal Brick Wall").
- **Structured Authority:** Every page renders `Organization` schema; Service pages render specific `Service` schema with pricing.
- **Semantic Mesh:** Internal linking and sitemap are optimized for crawler efficiency.
